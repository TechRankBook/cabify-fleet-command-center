# Vehicle Documents Fix - Test Guide

## Problem Fixed
- Documents uploaded via vehicle edit form were not visible in the Documents tab
- Fixed by bridging legacy vehicle document URLs with the dedicated vehicle_documents table

## Changes Made

### 1. VehicleDetailView.tsx
- Updated `fetchVehicleData()` to merge documents from both sources:
  - Legacy documents from vehicles table (insurance_document_url, registration_document_url, pollution_certificate_url)
  - New documents from vehicle_documents table
- Prioritizes newer documents from the dedicated table over legacy ones

### 2. VehicleDocumentsTab.tsx
- Updated `handleUpload()` to handle both legacy and new document types
- Updated `handleDelete()` to properly delete from correct table/field
- Added edit/replace functionality for all document types
- Added delete buttons for all document types
- Shows verification option only for non-legacy documents

## How It Works

1. **Display**: Documents from both sources are merged and displayed in the Documents tab
2. **Upload**: New documents are stored in the vehicle_documents table
3. **Replace Legacy**: When replacing a legacy document, it updates both the vehicles table and creates a new record in vehicle_documents table
4. **Delete**: 
   - Legacy documents: Clear the URL from vehicles table
   - New documents: Delete from vehicle_documents table

## Testing Steps

1. Go to Vehicles page
2. Find a vehicle with uploaded documents (should show in first screenshot)
3. Click "View Details" â†’ "Documents" tab
4. Documents should now be visible with View, Replace, Delete buttons
5. Test upload, replace, and delete functionality

## Database Schema

The fix utilizes both:
- `vehicles.insurance_document_url`, `vehicles.registration_document_url`, `vehicles.pollution_certificate_url`
- `vehicle_documents` table with proper document management features

Legacy documents are identified by ID prefix: `legacy-{type}-{vehicleId}`
